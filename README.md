<h1 align="center">HMPrint</h1>
<p align="center">An efficient and advanced model for identity authentication using physiological features</p>

# Introduction
The system, called **_HMPrint_**, uses outer ear microphones to capture air friction-induced acoustic effects (AFiSe) generated by head movements for identity verification.

# Demo
This is a demo video including four head gestures about HMPrint, mentioned in the paper **_Decoding Air Friction Rhythms: Enabling User Identification with Out-Ear
Microphones in COTS Earphones_**
